# CaseStudyMiniWallet

I have created an api where you can withdraw/deposit and query with CRUD operations that support different currencies. Unfortunately, there is no money conversion function for now. You can use your wallet with 3 different currencies.

It was developed using .Net 6 in the project. Entity Framework was used for CRUD operations. There are 3 methods for withdrawal, deposit and inquiry.
